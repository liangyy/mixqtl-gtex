# prepare_data

Prepare ASC, TRC, covariates matrices and library size, gene model data frames.

Here I skipped genotype pre-formatting. 
Essentially, it needs to be run once and it serves for all tissues.
The script used for this purpose is [here](https://github.com/liangyy/mixqtl-pipeline/blob/fd84079710a5b2310a1bdeb948ba329d6596bcd2/misc_scripts/prepare_data_for_py_mixqtl_runs/run_prepare_data.sh#L22).
